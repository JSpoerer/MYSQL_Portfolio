# Although i have no issue with writing this formula with a VBA, i frequently work with colleagues who aren't proficient in it's use.
# This project is to put all the calculations into a simple excel formula, meaning that they only need input the values
# The excel formula is as follows...'= Round((Cost * Mark_up)/Unit,decimal place)'
# Issues faced include people rounding before diving by the unit cost and using variations of round like round up.
